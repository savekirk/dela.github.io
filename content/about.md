I'm a software engineer who's been building things for over a decade. Mobile apps, backend systems, video/audio tools, and whatever else needs building.

I was one of the first three engineers at [SafeBoda](https://safeboda.com/uganda-website/about-us-ug). We built the MVP, and I stuck around as CTO for five years, growing the team to 30+ people from 18 countries. We turned it into the biggest two-wheel ride-hailing platform in Africa, running across four cities.

Before that, I worked with UNICEF on an offline-first mobile app that helped the Ghana Births and Deaths Registry register newborns. It's been used in over 150 districts since 2016. I also have been building multilingual farming decision support tools with [AfricaRice](https://www.riceadvice.info/en/riceadvice/) for over a decade.

Right now, I'm at Groovetime, using AI to build tools that help people learn dance moves from videos. Previously, I spent time at [PingPong](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pingpong) and [Grain](https://grain.com) working on video and audio recording and processing.

I mostly write Kotlin, Swift, Dart, Elixir, and TypeScript -- but I'll pick up whatever gets the job done.
